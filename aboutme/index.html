    <h2>Kamusta?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Hello, I'm Ariel, hailing from the beautiful island of the Philippines.
    Currently, my adventure involves pursuing a degree in Software Development.
    In my free time, you'll find me indulging in my passion for Anime movies,
    whipping up delicious dishes in the kitchen, and sharing the joy reading with
    my soon-to-be one-year-old son.<p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">In the realm of personal life, I've been enjoying the bliss of marriage
    for two  wonderful years, and we're about to celebrate our son's first birthday
    this monday. YOU ARE ALL INVITED. I work as an Administrative Assistant at
    a company in Australia.<p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">But that's not all. I've had the incredible opportunity to embark on a
    mission the heart of Africa, specifically the Ghana Kumasi Mission. So,
    if you're ever up for a chat or making a new friend, don't hesistate to
    reach out. I'm here to connect and share stories!</p>
